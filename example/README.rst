Example Application
===================

Requirements
------------

Python 3.9.

The Application
---------------

The application in ``app/`` is a simple database-less Django application with
debugging pages.

(Optional) Runnning the Application Locally
-------------------------------------------

We use vanilla venv, pip, and Django to run:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd app
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install -U pip wheel
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -m pip install -e ../..
   python manage.py runserver

Open it at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Deploying the Application
-------------------------

Best done in a separate terminal session, since there’s a second venv.

First, set yourself up to use the AWS account you want. This can be done by
configuring the AWS CLI in the usual way.

After you’ve done that, create a deployment venv, install Ansible and
other requirements into it, and run the deployment playbook:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd deployment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install -U pip wheel
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml

Ansible should complete with a ``PLAY RECAP`` at the end like:

.. code-block:: sh

   PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
   localhost                  : ok=12   changed=8    unreachable=0    failed=0

Check that ``failed=0`` - if not, see the preceding output for error
messages.

Also in the output there is a final ``debug`` task displaying the URL
your deployment can be accessed at in production - open it in a web
browser to check it out!

To Clean Up
-----------

The playbook creates two CloudFormation stacks prefixed with 'apig-wsgi', by
default in the eu-central-1 region. Delete the site stack, then delete the base
stack (which will require manual removal of the files in the S3 bucket).
